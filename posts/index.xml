          I want to talk about the problems that I have encountered setting up CORS between a Laravel backend server and a simple Html frontend hosted on a different domain, using the fetch API.
What is CORS  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.
